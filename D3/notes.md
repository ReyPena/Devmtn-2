###D3
D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents
----------------------------------------------------------------
D3 works with document csv that contain the data in form a array with many objects in it .
when the data come forme the csv file, it comes in form of a sting
the way we want start is by saying d3.csv("name of the document", type, fun).
----------------------------------------------------------------
with parseFloat you can turn an string into a number but it have to be out site outside of the d3 function and add to the function type as an argument, or by using "= +"
